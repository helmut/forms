# Fields

Forms gives you the tools to create your own custom fields. By extending the base `Field` class, your field can be easily used in any form you build. But you still have complete control over how it looks and feels.

In the same namespace (or folder) that you created your form in [Step 1](/src/README.md#step-1), create a folder called `Fields`. For example `path/to/my/app/forms/Fields`.
